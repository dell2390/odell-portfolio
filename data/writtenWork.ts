He has an audience of over 57 million people and a strong influence on the gaming community. Yet, he has mishandled that influence by promoting hate, bigotry, and ignorance, and some people are finally fed up. And quite frankly I am too.",

            "With the Wii U out in full effect, it’s only a matter of time before some of Nintendo’s longstanding franchises make the overdue jump into glorious HD. Metroid is an excellent series that features my favorite female protagonist: Samus Aran. Before the Nintendo delivers the goods on the inevitable next Metroid, here are some guidelines on making the game the best it can be.",

            "One of the industry’s best qualities is that a strange premise can make a great game. Super Smash Bros., Kingdom Hearts, and Katamari Damacy are all concepts that sound odd on paper but have created critically acclaimed franchises. Donut County has the potential to be such a title. It is a weird idea about a Racoon unleashing a remote-controlled hole in the ground that swallows up any and everything in its path.",

This sophomore effort picks up right where the action ended. Things have gone to the depths, and your decision-making abilities will be pushed until you’re questioning everyone’s motives, even your own.

A series I’ve grown up with and still adore, as much as I can within reason, to this day. The plot is something about Sonic being a bad boy, befriending a cop, and then a slew of fast pace antics occur. It will star James Marsden and Tika Sumpter as the male and female lead. And possibly feature Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik.",

When you suddenly realize you can’t wake up, the fear creeps into every corner of your mind because you’re actually trapped in a nightmare. It’s something many people have described going through, and though I’ve never experienced it myself, Compulsion Games’ We Happy Few is the closest I’ve gotten to the sensation.",
